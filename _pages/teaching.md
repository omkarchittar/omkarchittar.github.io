description: Proprietor and Teacher at SAI Classes; Mentor for FIRST LEGO League
---

## Overview

I care about making complex ideas feel simple and useful. I teach math and AI fundamentals and mentor students through hands-on projects that build confidence, curiosity, and real skills.

## FIRST LEGO League (FLL) — Mentor

**2024 – present**

- Coach middle school teams on strategy, robot design, and innovation projects.
- Break down topics like sensors, perception, and basic ML into friendly lessons.
- Guide teamwork, iteration, and clear communication.
- Help students present their work with demos, visuals, and short write-ups.

## SAI Classes — Proprietor and Teacher

**2016 – 2020**

- Taught **Linear Algebra, Calculus, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision** to 100+ undergraduates.
- Led a team of 10+ instructors and built a consistent teaching toolkit: lecture notes, problem sets, solution keys, and grading rubrics.
- Focused on linking theory to practice with short projects and open-book assessments.
- Coached students on study plans, internships, and project portfolios.

### Selected course units

- **Linear Algebra:** vector spaces, eigenvalues, SVD, applications to PCA and image compression.
- **Calculus:** optimization, gradients, constrained problems, numerical methods.
- **Machine Learning:** supervised learning, basic evaluation, data prep, model selection.
- **Computer Vision:** image filtering, feature extraction, segmentation, detection, tracking.

## Teaching principles

- **Clarity first:** start with an example, name the idea, then generalize.
- **Active practice:** short problems before long homework.
- **Feedback loops:** small checkpoints and quick corrections.
- **Show the “why”:** connect every topic to a working demo or real use case.

## What I am doing next

I am expanding my mentoring materials into short, reusable modules:

- Python notebooks for math and ML intuition
- Starter kits for robotics projects
- Presentation templates for student showcases

If you would like the materials or want me to mentor a team, **reach out at omkarchittar@gmail.com**.
