Hello! I'm Omkar Chittar.

As a passionate Computer Vision Engineer and educator, I've spent the past few years at the forefront of technology and innovation. With a Master's degree in Engineering, specializing in Robotics from the University of Maryland, and a rich professional background that includes leading projects at Sakar Robotics and contributing to advancements at DRDO, my journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and application in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. 

My portfolio showcases projects in computer vision, such as advanced 3D rendering, semantic segmentation, object detection and tracking. At Sakar Robotics, I spearheaded the development of cutting-edge localization and navigation systems, significantly enhancing their efficiency and accuracy. 

As the proprietor of SAI Classes, I not only imparted critical knowledge in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision but also managed a dedicated team of over 10 faculty members, fostering an environment of learning and innovation. My work is driven by a deep belief in the transformative power of technology and education, aiming to inspire and mentor the next generation of engineers and technologists.
