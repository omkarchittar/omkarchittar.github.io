During my tenure as the proprietor of SAI Classes, I had the distinct privilege of fostering an educational environment that not only emphasized the academic growth of over 100 undergraduate students but also their holistic development. My curriculum was meticulously designed to cover the complexities of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, ensuring a robust foundation for students aspiring to excel in these disciplines. Beyond the dissemination of knowledge, I dedicated myself to mentoring students on a personal level, offering guidance on navigating the challenges of academic life and making informed career decisions. This role allowed me to refine my pedagogical approach, emphasizing the practical application of theoretical concepts to real-world problems, thereby preparing students for the demands of the technology and engineering sectors. The experience was a testament to the power of education in shaping future innovators and problem-solvers, reinforcing my commitment to teaching and mentorship.

At SAI Classes, my responsibilities extended beyond teaching; I managed a team of over 10 faculty members, orchestrating a collaborative effort to design and implement a curriculum that was both comprehensive and conducive to learning. This involved the meticulous creation of assignments, tests, and grading criteria to ensure academic rigor and fairness in assessment. My role required a balance between leadership and partnership, as I worked closely with faculty to refine teaching methodologies and ensure that our educational offerings were aligned with the latest advancements in the fields of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. This experience not only reinforced my organizational and managerial skills but also underscored the importance of a cohesive team in delivering quality education.
