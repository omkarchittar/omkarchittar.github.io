Hello! I'm Omkar Chittar.

I am a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Robotics and Machine Learning. I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics from the University of Maryland, where I specialized in computer vision, machine learning, and intelligent systems. Over the years, I have combined my passion for applied AI with hands-on experience across industries such as media, robotics, and education.  

Most recently, I worked at **FOX Sports**, where I designed and deployed machine learning pipelines to support media post-production. My work included building AI systems to synchronize video with commentary, automate audio track selection, and streamline production workflows. This experience gave me deep exposure to large-scale data systems, cloud platforms, and real-world AI integration.  

Previously, I contributed to **Sakaar Robotics** and **DRDO**, where I worked on advanced computer vision projects involving localization, navigation, object detection, and tracking. These roles honed my ability to apply AI techniques to solve complex engineering problems with efficiency and accuracy.  

Beyond industry, I am deeply committed to **mentorship and education**. As a volunteer mentor for **FIRST Lego League (FLL)**, I guide middle school students in robotics, helping them simplify and understand challenging concepts in AI and engineering. Earlier, through **SAI Classes**, I taught courses in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, managing a team of 10 instructors and fostering a culture of learning and innovation.  

I thrive at the intersection of **AI, data, and impact**, with interests spanning computer vision, data engineering, and AI-driven decision systems. My goal is to leverage technology not just to build smarter systems, but also to create opportunities for the next generation of innovators.
